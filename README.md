# GraphConstraints
Bayesian conditional autoregressive models with graphconstraints for magnetic moment interaction in highentropy alloys

The script `Demo_simulations.m` demonstrates how to simulate data and carry out the estimation using CARGO. 

The script `Demo_real.m` demonstrates the application of CARGO to (Ni-Co-Cr-Fe) high entropy alloy real data.
