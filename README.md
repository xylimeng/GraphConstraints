# GraphConstraints
Bayesian conditional autoregressive models with graph constraints for magnetic moment interaction in high entropy alloys

The script `Demo_simulations.m` demonstrates how to simulate data and carry out the estimation using CARGO. 

The provided function `CARGO.m` is applicable for general graphical models with graph constraints. 

Visualization of POSCAR and VESTA files can be done in VESTA (https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/)
